	<h1>How to use the App</h1>

	<p>The application illustrates the key principles of portfolio
		optimisation.</p>

	<p>In the sections below, we talk about portfolio theory, diversification
		and portfolio composition. Also, we introduce key performance
		measures that are later used in our backtesting.</p>

	<p>The <strong>Portfolio allocation</strong> section allows you to chose
		financial instruments and build a portfolio to be simulated between
		the selected date range and a desired rebalancing schedule. The performance
		obtained is then compared to a selected benchmark.</p>

	<p> On the <strong>Allocation Comparison</strong> section, the portfolio is
		compared to two possible optmised portfolios which had similar performances
		during the same analysis period: a portfolio with the same return and lower risk, and a
		portfolio with the same risk and higher return.</p>
